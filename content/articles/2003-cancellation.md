Sciwork will be canceled this year because of the COVID-19 outbreak.

We have [rescheduled once]({filename}./2002-new-date.md) because of the
epidemic.  Since then the situation has become worsened and we are seeing
rapidly-growing infections in the world.  Although in Taiwan it is relatively
well-controlled, so far, the found cases are still increasing and we are close
to or already in community spread.  After careful assessment, we learn that the
safety of all participants is of high risk in this time, and have to make the
hard decision to cancel the conference.

Every participant will get full refund.  You do **not** need to cancel on
KKTIX.  Instead, please submit the following information to the
[form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMhSD_dX2jHP7bPeoxOusJCXKqyF43hsqiFKU6595yXGhE4Q/viewform):

> Subject: [sw20] Refund information for `<your name in KKTIX ticket>`
>
>   * Email in your KKTIX ticket
>   * Check-in Serial Code (檢查碼) in your KKTIX ticket (you should have got
>     an email from KKTIX for it)
>   * Account information:
>     * Bank code (銀行名稱代號)
>     * Branch code (分行名稱代號)
>     * Account name (戶名)
>     * Account number (帳號)

The refund will take some time to process, and we will appreciate your
understanding.  The organizers will cover all the incurred overhead, and would
like to ask everyone to submit the information for refund.

Although the conference is pushed back to next year, the organizers will
continue to hold smaller-scale events to promote the sharing and discussion of
computer code for scientific, numerical, and engineering work.  The subsequent
events were planned with the conference already, but the team need some time to
put them together.  Further updates will be posted
